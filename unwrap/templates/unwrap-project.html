        <p>Our goal is to ease the transition to a plastic-free living in the great LA area. Our solution is to offer alternatives to our community and partner with brands that want and are ready to give alternatives.</p>
        <p>We want to keep it <b> easy, clean and accessible.</b> Our First step is Refill@home. A customizable "box" of locally made products in locally made containers that we can refill. Our ultimate goal is to open a physical spot in LA for plastic concerned customers. </p>
